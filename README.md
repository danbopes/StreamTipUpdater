# Stream Tip Updater
A way to group stream tip donations for a specific month (And export to OBS/excel). Made for [oarsman79 on twitch](http://twitch.tv/oarsman79)

## How to use

Just add the `client_id` and `access_id` from streamtip into the `.config` file, and you're good to go! Right click the ST in the lower right hand corner to export users to excel, and navigate to the `obs/` folder for `.txt` files to use in [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/).
